# Automated-Shopping-Cart

The project involves a smart shopping cart that automatically follows the user while shopping. The cart integrates a system for QR code scanning to identify items as they are placed into the cart, allowing for real-time bill generation. This system automates the shopping process, eliminating the need for manual scanning at checkout, and enhances the shopping experience with its autonomous movement and seamless billing.

Here's the video of demonstration:
